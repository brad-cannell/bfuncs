#' @title Confusion Matrix
#'
#' @description Create a confusion matrix along with the following measures
#'  of performance
#'
#' @param truth A vector containing actual or "gold standard" outcomes.
#' @param prediction A vector containing predicted values or observed
#'  diagnostic values.
#' @param show_matrix A logical (TRUE or FALSE). Set to TRUE by default. Change
#'  to FALSE if you want a confusion matrix table to be printed to the console.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{Sensativity}{(also called the true positive rate, or the recall
#'      in some fields) measures the proportion of positives that are
#'      correctly classified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who
#'      are correctly classified as having the condition).}
#'    \item{Specificity}{(also called the true negative rate) measures the
#'      proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g.,
#'      the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not
#'      having the condition).}
#'    \item{FPR}{False Positive Rate (Not really a rate). Measures the
#'      proportion of negatives that are incorrectly classified as a positive.
#'      1 - specificity.}
#'    \item{FNR}{False Negative Rate (Not really a rate). Measures the
#'      proportion of positives that are incorrectly classified as a negative.
#'      1 â€“ sensitivity.}
#'    \item{FDR}{False Discovery Rate. Measures the proportion of cases
#'      predicted positive, that were truly negative.}
#'    \item{Accuracy}{The overall proportion of correctly classified
#'      observations.}
#'    \item{Misclassification}{The overall proportion of incorrectly classified
#'      observations.}
#'    \item{Precision}{The overall proportion of incorrectly classified
#'      observations.}
#'    \item{Prevalence}{The overall proportion of true positives.}

## Still need to update unit tests:
# Test that should work, works
# tlf <- factor(detect$cg_deceptive46, levels = c("No", "Yes"))
# conf_matrix(detect$any_valid_f, tlf)
# Works

# Test different classes for error
# conf_matrix(detect$any_valid, tlf)
# Correct error

# Test that truth has 2 levels (factor)
# xf <- factor(rep(c("No", "Yes", "Don't Know", "Not Sure"), 10))
# conf_matrix(xf, tlf)
# Correct error

# Test that truth has 2 unique values (not factor)
# xc <- rep(c("No", "Yes", "Don't Know", "Not Sure"), 10)
# tlc <- rep(c("No", "Yes"), 20)
# conf_matrix(xc, tlc)
# Correct error

# Test that prediction has 2 levels
# conf_matrix(detect$any_valid_f, detect$cg_deceptive46)
# Correct error

# Test that prediction has 2 unique values (not factor)
# conf_matrix(tlc, xc)
# Correct error

# Test that truth and prediction have the same set of values
# x1 <- factor(c("No", "Yes"))
# x2 <- factor(c("No", "Yes"))
# x3 <- factor(c("Yes", "No"))
# x4 <- factor(c("foo", "bar"))
# conf_matrix(x1, x2)
# Works
# conf_matrix(x1, x3)
# Works
# conf_matrix(x1, x4)
# Correct error

# Test turn off show matrix
# conf_matrix(detect$any_valid_f, tlf, show_matrix = FALSE)
