\description{
The codebook function assists with the creation of a codebook for a given
 data frame.
}
\details{
Codebook expects that `df ` is a data frame that you have read into memory
from a saved data file. Please provide the path to the saved data file. This
function gets selected attributes about file saved at `path` and stores
those attributes in a data frame, which is later turned into a flextable and
added to the codebook document.
