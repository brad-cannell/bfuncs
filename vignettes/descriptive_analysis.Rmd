I initially created this file to help develop the `freq_table` function in `bfuncs`. I've since adapted it to encompass general descriptive data analysis using R in a `dplyr` pipeline. Herein, descriptive analysis refers to basic univariate or bivariate statistics calculated for continuous and categorical variables (e.g., means and percentages). This vignette is not intended to be representative of every possible descriptive analysis that one may want to carry out on a given data set. Rather, it is intended to be representative of the descriptive analyses I most commonly need while conducting epidemiologic research.

```{r}

library(bfuncs)

```{r}
data(mtcars)

# Univariate means and 95% confidence intervals {#univariate-means}

In this example, we will calculate the overall mean and 95% confidence interval for the variable mpg in the mtcars data set. 

By default, only the n, mean, and 95% confidence interval for the mean are returned. Additionally, the values of all the returned statistics are rounded to the hundredths place. These are the numerical summaries of the data that I am most frequently interested in. Additionally, I rarely need the precision of the estimates to be any greater than the hundredths place.

The confidence intervals are calculated as:

$$ {\bar{x} \pm t_{(1-\alpha / 2, n-1)}} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$

&nbsp;

This matches the method used by SAS: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/65145/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0klmrp4k89pz0n1p72t0clpavyx.htm

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mean_table(mpg)
```

By adjusting the `t_prob` parameter, it is possible to change the width of the confidence intervals. The example below returns a 99% confidence interval.

The value for t_prob is calculated as 1 - alpha / 2.

```{r}
alpha <- 1 - .99
t <- 1 - alpha / 2

mtcars %>% 
  mean_table(mpg, t_prob = t)
```

With the `output = "all"` option, mean_table also returns the number of missing values, the critical value from student's t distribution with degrees of freedom n - 1, and the standard error of the mean.

We can also control the precision of the statistics using the `digits` parameter.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mean_table(mpg, output = "all", digits = 5)
```

This output matches the results obtained from SAS proc means and the Stata mean command (shown below).

Finally, the object returned by `mean_table` is given the class `mean_table` when the data frame passed to the `.data` argument is an ungrouped tibble.

# Bivariate means and 95% confidence intervals {#bivariate-means}

The methods used to calculate bivariate means and confidence are identical to those used to calculate univariate means and confidence intervals. Additionally, all of the options shown above work identically for bivariate analysis. In order to estimate bivariate (subgroup) means and confidence intervals over levels of a categorical variable, the `.data` argument to `mean_table` should be a grouped tibble created with `dplyr::group_by`. Everything else should "just work."

The object returned by `mean_table` is given the class `mean_table_grouped` when the data frame passed to the `.data` argument is a grouped tibble (i.e., `grouped_df`). 

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  mean_table(mpg, output = "all", digits = 5)
```

For comparison, here is the output from SAS proc means and the Stata mean command.

# Univariate percentages and 95% Wald confidence intervals {#one-way-log}

In this section I provide an example of calculating common univariate descriptive statistics for categorical variables. Again, we are assuming that we are working in a *dplyr* pipeline, and that we are passing a grouped data frame to the `freq_table` function.

## Logit transformed confidence intervals

The default confidence intervals are logit transformed - matching the method used by Stata: https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rproportion.pdf

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am) %>% 
  freq_table(output = "all", digits = 5)
```

## Wald confidence intervals {#one-way-wald}

Optionally, the `ci_type = "wald"` argument can be used to calculate Wald confidence intervals that match those returned by SAS.

The exact methods are documented here:

https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_surveyfreq_a0000000221.htm

https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_surveyfreq_a0000000217.htm

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am) %>% 
  freq_table(ci_type = "wald", output = "all", digits = 5)
```

# Bivariate percentages and 95% log transformed confidence intervals {#two-way-log}

In this section I provide an example of calculating common bivariate descriptive statistics for categorical variables. Again, we are assuming that we are working in a *dplyr* pipeline, and that we are passing a grouped data frame to the `freq_table` function.

Currently, all confidence intervals for (grouped) row percentages, and their accompanying confidence intervals, are logit transformed - matching the method used by Stata: https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rproportion.pdf

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am, cyl) %>% 
  freq_table(output = "all", digits = 5)
```

&nbsp;

These estimates do not match those generated by SAS, which uses a different variance estimation method (https://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_surveyfreq_a0000000217.htm).
